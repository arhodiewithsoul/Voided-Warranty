# Voided Warranty
 This repository is a reference for hacked/customised/modified, firmware/software/physical parts, used in building/rebuilding 3D printers.
 
 Sometimes you have components lying around which you want to use... Sometimes you just want to approach the problem from a different angle or with a different solution. This repository acts as a reference for off-spec components which have been proven to work.
